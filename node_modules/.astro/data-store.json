This year’s theme, Sustainable Space for Sustainability on Earth, highlights the role of space technologies in addressing pressing global issues like climate change, resource management, and socio-economic inequality.\n\nWhile the innovations presented at the forum have great potential, their success hinges on one key element: effective stakeholder engagement. This involves fostering collaboration across governments, industries, and academia while ensuring that strategies are well-targeted, messages are clear, and information is accessible to diverse audiences.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we specialise in helping organisations navigate these complexities. By crafting tailored communication strategies, we ensure that sustainability efforts resonate with the right audiences and lead to impactful change.\n\n## Key Topics and the Role of Stakeholder Engagement\n\n1. Space and Climate Action: Bridging the Information Gap\n\nSpace technologies play a vital role in monitoring and addressing climate change. From tracking greenhouse gas emissions to enabling early warning systems for extreme weather, these tools provide critical data. However, their impact depends on effectively sharing this information with decision-makers, businesses, and the public.\n\nKey engagement strategies include:\n\n- Identifying audiences: Tailored information helps policy-makers, scientists, businesses, and citizens take informed action.\n\n- Crafting clear narratives: Complex data must be translated into practical insights. For instance, showcasing how satellite imagery aids disaster preparedness can highlight its tangible value.\n\n- Encouraging collaboration: Partnerships across sectors transform space data into real-world solutions.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we have extensive experience designing communication strategies for programmes like Copernicus, ensuring their societal value is recognised and utilised effectively.\n\n2. Sustainable Space Operations: Building a Shared Understanding\n\nManaging sustainable space operations, such as reducing orbital debris and adopting eco-friendly technologies, requires cooperation among various stakeholders, including space agencies, private companies, and regulators.\n\nEngagement strategies to address these challenges:\n\n- Aligning goals: Stakeholders need a shared understanding of sustainability and its implications for long-term space operations.\n\n- Tailored messaging: Engineers, regulators, and the public require information suited to their specific concerns.\n\n- Promoting transparency: Openly sharing sustainability goals and progress builds trust and fosters collaboration.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital supports organisations in communicating their efforts in sustainable space practices, helping them create narratives that connect with both technical and general audiences.\n\n3. Space for Socio-Economic Benefits: Engaging Communities\n\nSpace technologies, like satellite internet and renewable energy systems, hold immense potential for addressing socio-economic challenges. However, their success relies on meaningful engagement with the communities they aim to benefit.\n\nKey considerations include:\n\n- Understanding needs: Local engagement ensures technologies are designed with end-users in mind.\n\n- Demonstrating impact: People are more likely to support technologies when their benefits—such as better connectivity or energy access—are clearly communicated.\n\n- Empowering stakeholders: Involving communities in the design and implementation of projects fosters long-term support and adoption.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital helps organisations articulate the socio-economic value of their technologies, ensuring that their contributions are embraced by the communities they serve.\n\n## The Importance of Audience-Centric Strategies\n\nEffective communication is about more than just delivering information—it’s about knowing your audience and tailoring messages accordingly.\n\nCore principles include:\n\n- Clarity: Avoid jargon and focus on how technologies address real-world challenges.\n\n- Relevance: Highlight benefits that resonate with specific audiences, whether they’re policy-makers, investors, or the public.\n\n- Engagement: Foster dialogue and feedback to build trust and mutual understanding.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital specialises in crafting audience-centric strategies that ensure messages not only reach the intended recipients but also inspire action.\n\n## Green Orbit Digital’s Contribution to the Forum\n\nOur participation in the World Space Forum 2024 reflects our dedication to supporting the integration of sustainability into space operations. We understand that stakeholder engagement is the cornerstone of this transition.\n\nBy helping organisations develop effective communication strategies, we:\n\n- Build stronger partnerships across sectors.\n\n- Foster public understanding and support for sustainable practices.\n\n- Accelerate the adoption of technologies addressing global challenges.\n\nAs the space industry evolves, the demand for clear, audience-focused messaging continues to grow. Green Orbit Digital is proud to contribute its expertise to advancing sustainability in the sector, driving meaningful change both on Earth and in space.\n\nWe look forward to collaborating with global stakeholders at the forum, sharing ideas, and advancing efforts to make the space sector a model for sustainable practices.","src/content/blog/world-space-forum-2024.md","2a34735bc228bb42",{"html":34,"metadata":35},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-importance-of-stakeholder-engagement-in-advancing-sustainable-space-practices\">The Importance of Stakeholder Engagement in Advancing Sustainable Space Practices\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The United Nations World Space Forum 2024, held from 3-5 December in Bonn, Germany, is a crucial platform for exploring how sustainability can be integrated into space activities.

Over three days, scientists, policymakers, data providers, and technology leaders came together to explore how satellite-derived climate information can be more effectively integrated into decision-making and service design.\n\n\n### **Bridging the Gap Between Space Data and Climate Action**\n\nThe symposium’s focus on *co-creation* resonated strongly with us at **Green Orbit Digital**. Our work often sits at the intersection of **space, sustainability, and communication**, helping organisations translate complex climate and environmental data into narratives that inform, inspire, and mobilise action.\n\nAcross sessions, a recurring theme was the importance of connecting the technical capabilities of Europe’s Earth observation infrastructure with the societal needs it serves. Whether through the **Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)**, the **EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facilities (SAFs)**, or national climate centres, the challenge is no longer just about generating data—it’s about making it meaningful.\n\nKey discussions throughout the symposium explored how to:\n\n- Align satellite-based data with evolving **climate policy frameworks** in Europe and globally.\n- Strengthen collaboration between **research institutions, operational services, and industry**.\n- Harness emerging technologies such as **AI, machine learning, and cloud computing** to improve data accessibility.\n- Quantify and communicate the **socio-economic value** of climate information to decision-makers and the public.\n\nThese themes directly mirror the work we champion at Green Orbit Digital—helping partners in the space and sustainability sectors design **data-driven narratives** that build trust, demonstrate impact, and accelerate the uptake of environmental innovation.\n\n\n### **Co-Creation in Practice: The Break-Out Sessions**\n\nOne of the most dynamic aspects of the symposium was the series of **Break-Out Sessions** on 29 October, where participants collaborated on practical approaches to real-world challenges. Each session was led by an operational or research institution, creating space for open dialogue between scientists, service providers, and users.\n\nTopics ranged from **solar energy forecasting** and **drought monitoring** to **marine applications**, **hydrological modelling**, and **heat management** in urban areas. Others addressed how to better **bridge data and demand**, ensuring that climate services meet the needs of different user groups—from policymakers to local planners and businesses.\n\nA recurring insight across the discussions was that **user engagement must happen from the very beginning**. Data products alone are not enough; their value emerges when they are co-designed with those who depend on them. That idea—turning data into dialogue—is central to how we approach sustainability communication at Green Orbit Digital.\n\n\n### **Exploring the Fair of Opportunities**\n\nRunning throughout the symposium was the **Fair of Opportunities**, an open exhibition showcasing Europe’s rich ecosystem of climate data services. Organised into thematic “islands”, it brought together contributors from across the **EUMETSAT SAF network**, the **Copernicus services**, and leading research institutions.\n\nExhibitors demonstrated how satellite-based data supports applications in **solar energy, drought management, marine and heat monitoring, and global climate observation**—each essential to Europe’s path toward climate resilience.\n\nFor us, the Fair was a tangible reminder that the communication of these capabilities is as vital as the technologies themselves. In many ways, the most powerful form of innovation happens not only in laboratories and control rooms, but in how these advancements are **shared, contextualised, and understood** by those shaping the future of our planet.\n\n\n### **From Data to Dialogue**\n\nThroughout the symposium, one message was clear: the future of climate services depends on collaboration—not only between research and operations, but also across sectors and disciplines. The integration of AI and cloud computing will open new possibilities for processing and visualising satellite data, but technology alone won’t drive impact. That comes from **co-creation**, **accessibility**, and **effective storytelling**.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, this aligns directly with our mission. We work with organisations across the space and environmental sectors to make **complex climate intelligence accessible**, designing communication strategies and digital platforms that help translate data into understanding and understanding into action.\n\nThe conversations in Darmstadt reaffirmed the value of this work. As EUMETSAT and its partners look toward the next generation of Earth observation systems, it is clear that data literacy, design thinking, and strategic communication will play a pivotal role in ensuring these systems deliver their full societal benefit.\n\n\n### **Looking Forward**\n\nThe symposium closed with a celebration of **25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT**—a testament to Europe’s sustained commitment to using space-based observation for the common good. It also served as a forward-looking reflection on how the next 25 years will require even greater integration between science, technology, and communication.\n\nFor Green Orbit Digital, participation in this milestone event was both an opportunity to engage with the European climate data community and a reminder of the responsibility we share—to ensure that the insights captured from space are translated into impact on Earth.\n\nThe conversations sparked in Darmstadt will continue to inform how we approach our work: using digital storytelling, sustainable marketing, and data strategy to help bridge the gap between **observation and action**—from orbit to outcome.","src/content/news/eumetsat-climate-symposium.md","b4f0fe8a27f8cabd",{"html":386,"metadata":387},"\u003Cp>In late October, Green Orbit Digital joined delegates from across Europe’s climate and space communities in Darmstadt for the \u003Cstrong>EUMETSAT Climate Symposium 2025\u003C/strong>, held under the theme \u003Cem>“From Space to Climate Service: Co-creation in Action.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The event marked \u003Cstrong>25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT\u003C/strong>—a milestone in Europe’s commitment to operational climate monitoring and the use of satellite data to inform policy, drive innovation, and ultimately serve society.

At Green Orbit Digital, we were proud to participate in the **2025 Green Growth Programme**, a free six-week initiative run by Small Business Britain in partnership with BT. Designed specifically for SMEs, the programme equips businesses with the **knowledge, tools, and confidence to leverage sustainability as a driver of financial performance, operational efficiency, and brand reputation**.\n\nOur participation offered **hands-on learning, peer exchange, and actionable insights** that are directly relevant to our work helping clients in the space, technology, and high-tech sectors communicate their sustainability stories and integrate eco-conscious practices across their operations.\n\n\n## **Making the Business Case for Sustainability**\n\nThe programme opened on **18th September** with an exploration of the **business rationale for sustainability**. Drawing on evidence from the **Willow Review**, participants examined how sustainability initiatives can translate into **tangible business benefits**: reducing costs through energy efficiency, enhancing resilience against supply chain shocks, and strengthening competitive positioning.\n\nFor Green Orbit, this session underscored a critical lesson: **sustainability is not just about environmental stewardship—it is a strategic lever for growth**. We reflected on how clients in the space sector, for example, can integrate sustainable practices into satellite manufacturing, launch planning, and operational protocols, and how these actions, when communicated clearly, enhance both credibility and stakeholder confidence.\n\n> “Sustainability isn’t just about doing good—it’s about doing well. The right actions create value for the planet, your customers, and your bottom line.” – Ryan Laird, Director, Green Orbit Digital\n> \n\n\n## **Quick Wins: Practical Sustainability Actions**\n\nThe session on **25th September** focused on **quick wins for SMEs**, highlighting the 5-point plan for immediate action. Low-cost interventions such as optimising energy use, reducing paper and plastic consumption, and implementing smarter procurement strategies were presented as **high-impact measures with immediate returns**.\n\nAt Green Orbit, we took these lessons and applied them internally: upgrading office systems to more energy-efficient alternatives, reducing travel emissions through virtual meetings, and streamlining procurement to favour sustainable suppliers. Beyond operational improvements, these actions inform **our client advisory work**, allowing us to guide SMEs on practical sustainability measures that are credible, measurable, and communicable through marketing channels.\n\n\n## **Harnessing AI and Digital Tools for Sustainability**\n\nThe **2nd October session** explored the role of **AI and digital technologies** in achieving sustainability goals. From energy monitoring systems to AI-driven logistics optimisation, digital tools can deliver efficiency gains while reducing environmental impact.\n\nFor Green Orbit, the session provided actionable insights into **how technology intersects with marketing and communications**. Using AI and analytics, we can track and showcase sustainability progress for clients, identify opportunities to reduce resource use, and support campaigns that demonstrate **genuine impact rather than superficial claims**. This capability strengthens both operational performance and brand narrative.\n\n\n## **Marketing Green: Communicating Sustainability Authentically**\n\nOn **9th October**, the focus shifted to **marketing sustainability effectively**. Consumers today expect transparency and authenticity, and poorly communicated sustainability efforts risk reputational damage. The session emphasised **storytelling, clear messaging, and aligning brand values with actionable commitments**.\n\nThis aligns seamlessly with Green Orbit’s mission. We help clients articulate their sustainability journey in ways that are **credible, compelling, and measurable**. Whether highlighting low-carbon initiatives, community engagement, or innovative eco-solutions, communicating authentically allows businesses to **attract ethically conscious customers, strengthen stakeholder trust, and differentiate in competitive markets**.\n\n\n## **Financing Sustainable Growth**\n\nThe **16th October session** provided SMEs with insights into **financial tools for sustainability**, including grants, loans, and green finance mechanisms. Understanding how to access funding is essential to scale initiatives beyond small pilot projects.\n\nGreen Orbit now integrates this perspective into our advisory services, helping clients **identify financing opportunities for sustainable projects** and develop communications that appeal to investors, partners, and customers. Sustainability becomes not only a moral imperative but a **business opportunity backed by financial planning**.\n\n\n## **Planning for Long-Term Impact**\n\nThe final session on **23rd October** addressed **sustaining gains over time**. Participants learned how to track progress, maintain momentum, and remain connected with sustainability networks and support systems.\n\nFor Green Orbit, long-term planning is central to our approach. By combining strategic planning, ongoing measurement, and responsible communications, we help clients ensure their sustainability initiatives are **durable, measurable, and aligned with brand purpose**. Whether tracking carbon reductions, reporting on ethical sourcing, or documenting community engagement, consistent communication strengthens both impact and credibility.\n\n\n## **Green Orbit’s Key Takeaways**\n\nParticipation in the Green Growth Programme has reinforced several principles that underpin our work at Green Orbit Digital:\n\n- Sustainability initiatives **deliver tangible business value** when strategically planned and executed.\n- Responsible communications are **essential for credibility, customer engagement, and brand differentiation**.\n- Accessing funding and leveraging technology amplifies sustainability efforts and ensures **scalability**.\n- Long-term impact relies on **measurement, reporting, and continuous improvement**, supported by robust marketing strategies.\n\n> “Sustainability is only as powerful as the story you tell about it. At Green Orbit, we help organisations act responsibly, communicate responsibly, and grow responsibly.” – Ryan Laird, Director\n> \n\n\n## **Take Action: Build Your Sustainable Growth Strategy**\n\nThe 2025 Green Growth Programme has now reached full capacity, but SMEs can **sign up to be the first to hear about the next round**.

Joining a network of 45 global leaders, we are committed to advancing space sustainability, mitigating the risks of orbital debris, and ensuring long-term safety for space operations. This underscores Green Orbit Digital’s support innovative and responsible solutions to the growing challenges of space sustainability.\n\n## Why Space Sustainability Is Critical\n\nSpace is vital to modern society, supporting global communications, navigation, climate monitoring, and disaster management. However, the orbital environment faces significant risks. The European Space Agency (ESA) estimates over 40,500 large debris objects, 1.1 million fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm, and 130 million smaller fragments currently orbit Earth.\n\nThese fragments, traveling at speeds of 28,000 km/h, pose severe risks to satellites, space missions, and even the International Space Station (ISS). A collision with even a small fragment could result in catastrophic damage. Without proactive measures, the orbital environment may become increasingly congested and hazardous, impacting both current operations and future exploration.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s endorsement of SSC’s Version 2.39 Best Practices aligns with the urgent need to tackle these challenges and support the sustainable growth of the space industry.\n\n## SSC’s Best Practices: A Framework for Sustainable Space\n\nThe SSC’s Best Practices are designed to address the complexities of orbital sustainability through clear, actionable guidelines. These principles, aligned with international standards such as the UN COPUOS Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines and ISO 24113, promote responsible operations and collaboration across the space sector.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n1. Preventing Orbital Debris: Encouraging responsible satellite design and mission planning to minimise waste.\n\n1. Post-Mission Disposal: Supporting the timely deorbiting of spacecraft and spent stages.\n\n1. Enhancing Data Sharing: Improving space situational awareness (SSA) by fostering open communication among operators.\n\n1. Sustainable Design: Promoting technologies that enable efficient tracking, collision avoidance, and end-of-life disposal.\n\n1. Eco-Friendly Launch Practices: Advocating for reusable rockets and green propellants to reduce the environmental footprint of launches.\n\nThese guidelines provide a foundation for creating a safer and more sustainable orbital environment.\n\n## Tackling Orbital Debris: Innovative Solutions\n\nInnovative technologies are emerging to address the pressing issue of orbital debris:\n\n- Active Debris Removal (ADR): Companies like Astroscale are pioneering ADR missions, including ELSA-d, which aims to capture and remove non-functional satellites from orbit.\n\n- Passive Deorbit Technologies: Drag sails developed by companies like Vestigo Aerospace accelerate satellite re-entry at the end of their operational lifecycle.\n\n- Advanced Tracking Systems: Organisations such as LeoLabs provide radar-based solutions to monitor and predict debris movements, enabling safer navigation and collision avoidance.\n\nWhile these technologies show great promise, challenges such as high costs, scalability, and the need for international cooperation must be addressed to implement them effectively.\n\n## The Economic Imperative of Space Sustainability\n\nSpace sustainability is not just an environmental concern; it is an economic necessity. Operators now spend millions annually on collision avoidance manoeuvres, which consume valuable satellite resources and shorten mission lifespans. Rising insurance premiums further reflect the growing risks posed by space debris.\n\nIf left unaddressed, the economic burden of space debris could exceed billions of dollars annually, as projected by the Secure World Foundation. Proactive investment in sustainability today will prevent greater costs in the future, preserving the financial viability of space operations.\n\n## Governance and Collaboration: A Unified Approach\n\nVoluntary guidelines like the SSC’s Best Practices provide a strong foundation, but binding international regulations are essential for long-term sustainability. Bodies like the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) must work towards:\n\n- Establishing mandatory compliance with debris mitigation standards like ISO 24113.\n\n- Incentivising sustainable practices through grants, tax breaks, or priority access to orbital slots.\n\n- Implementing penalties for non-compliance to deter irresponsible behaviour.\n\nCollaboration between governments, commercial operators, and civil society will be key to addressing these governance challenges and ensuring equitable access to orbital resources.\n\n## Green Orbit Digital: Empowering Space Sustainability\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we recognise that space sustainability is not just about avoiding risk—it is an opportunity to drive innovation, build public trust, and ensure the long-term growth of the space economy. As a sustainability-driven marketing agency, we:\n\n- Raise Awareness: Bridging the gap between technical experts and the public to amplify the importance of sustainable space operations.\n\n- Support Collaboration: Empowering businesses to align with global sustainability goals through actionable strategies.\n\n- Inspire Future Generations: Engaging young professionals to prioritise sustainability in their careers through education and outreach.\n\nBy integrating sustainability into our core operations, we aim to lead by example and inspire collective action across the industry.\n\n## Join the Mission for a Sustainable Orbital Future\n\nGreen Orbit Digital invites spacefaring organisations to endorse the SSC’s Best Practices and contribute to safeguarding the orbital environment. By taking proactive steps now, we can ensure space remains a resource for innovation, exploration, and opportunity.\n\nTo learn more about the SSC’s Best Practices and how to participate, visit SpaceSafety.org or contact info@spacesafety.org.","src/content/news/green-orbit-digital-endorses-space-sustainability.md","287c424821944cd0",{"html":695,"metadata":696},"\u003Cp>Green Orbit Digital is proud endorse the Space Safety Coalition’s (SSC) Best Practices for the Sustainability of Space Operations.

Credit: Space Renaissance International.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital is proud to announce its participation in the Space 18th SDG Coalition’s second annual workshop, taking place on 19 September 2024 at the United Nations Plaza in New York and online. As one of 94 space-stakeholder organisations united under this coalition, we are thrilled to contribute to global discussions on the critical role of space in building a sustainable and peaceful future.\n\nThe hybrid event, which marks the lead-up to World Space Week, will gather industry leaders, space development experts, and policy influencers to address the significance of civilian-led space initiatives in advancing sustainable development goals. A key focus of this year’s workshop is the proposed 18th SDG, dedicated to sustainable space development, a theme closely aligned with Green Orbit Digital’s mission to promote eco-conscious ventures in the space sector.\n\n## Green Orbit Digital at the Forefront of Space Sustainability\n\nRyan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital, will speak as part of the prestigious “Space Symposium for the Future” session, moderated by Adriano V. Autino, Founder of Space Renaissance International (SRI). Ryan’s talk, titled “Engaging Stakeholders in Sustainable Space Development for a Resilient Future,” will delve into strategies for fostering robust stakeholder engagement aligned with both the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda.\n\nRyan will explore the unique challenges and opportunities of involving diverse actors—governments, private enterprises, NGOs, and the general public—in the narrative of space as a frontier for sustainable economic and social growth. His presentation will highlight best practices in sustainable marketing, focusing on crafting compelling narratives that resonate across different sectors and cultures. Emphasising transparency, inclusivity, and ethical considerations, Ryan will discuss how these elements build trust and secure long-term commitment from stakeholders.\n\nThe talk will also address the role of education and awareness in bridging knowledge gaps, fostering a sense of shared purpose, and promoting the idea of space development as a key driver of global sustainability. By effectively engaging stakeholders, we can ensure that the expansion into the cislunar economy and beyond is not only technologically and economically viable but also socially and environmentally sustainable.\n\n## Key Sessions and Highlights\n\nThe workshop will feature two core sessions:\n\n1. Space Symposium for the Future (9:00 AM US EDT): Bringing together keynote speakers from organisations such as The Mars Society, the Human Space Program, and the Lifeboat Foundation, the session will explore the potential of space development in driving global progress.\n\n1. Space Workshop for the Future (2:30 PM US EDT): Facilitated by Robert S. Katz of the World Innovation Network (WIN), this interactive segment will feature five focused tracks covering key areas such as the Space 2030 Agenda, Space for Peace, Economic and Social Growth, Young Generations in Space, and Earth’s Sustainability.\n\n## Looking Ahead: The Space for the Future Report\n\nThe outcomes of this event will feed into the final Space for the Future report, set to be released on 10 October 2024. The report will provide actionable recommendations to inform the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda, addressing the need for coordinated efforts to integrate space technology into sustainable development frameworks.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital is excited to engage in these vital conversations, furthering our mission of embedding sustainability into the heart of space ventures. We invite all stakeholders to join us in-person or virtually, as we work towards a future where space development serves as a pillar of sustainability and peace for our planet and beyond.\n\nEvent Details:\n\n- Date: 19 September 2024\n\n- Time: 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM (US EDT)/2:00 PM – 11:30 PM (BST)/3:00 PM  – 00:30 AM (CEST)\n\n- Location: 777 United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10017\n\n- To attend in person: Registration Link\n\n- To follow the live stream: YouTube Live\n\nWe look forward to collaborating with global leaders and space enthusiasts to shape a sustainable future for space exploration and development.","src/content/news/green-orbit-space-18th-sdg-un-workshop.md","e25d4171a45bc46a",{"html":916,"metadata":917},"\u003Cp>A Space 18th SDG for the Future, a Hybrid Workshop.

Our mission is to propel space-related businesses toward eco-conscious practices and inspire a brighter, more sustainable future. \n\nThe space industry, with its remarkable potential for discovery and innovation, now stands at a crossroads. As we see unprecedented growth in the sector, there is a critical need for responsible stewardship. There is an emerging realisation that our growing access to space must align with sustainable principles, safeguarding not only our earthly home but beyond as we reach out beyond our planet. In this defining moment, Green Orbit Digital emerges as the catalyst, the change-maker, and the visionary that the space industry has been waiting for.\n\n## A Sustainable Approach to Reach for the Stars\n\nIn recent years, we’ve seen the rise of sustainability as an imperative force, reshaping industries worldwide. Sustainability is not just a buzzword but a call to action, an ethos that has revolutionised how businesses operate. The space industry is no exception. While the allure of the cosmos beckons us forward, we recognise that our presence in space must echo our commitment to preserving our fragile planet. At Green Orbit Digital, we’ve accepted the challenge and present the space industry with a compelling case – a business case for sustainability.\n\nOur journey begins with a fundamental premise: the future of space exploration should be awe-inspiring and environmentally responsible. In an age where corporate social responsibility is paramount, space-related businesses must embrace sustainability at their core. Why? It’s not only because a greener approach is morally essential but also because it’s strategically astute. The global community is now looking to the stars with hopeful eyes, desiring not only scientific achievements but also eco-conscious practices. By incorporating sustainability into their marketing, space companies can unlock numerous benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced Reputation and Trust: Sustainability resonates with the values of the masses. Embracing eco-conscious practices not only builds trust with your audience but also empowers them to be advocates of your mission.\n\n2. Competitive Edge: Space is no longer just the playground of governments. Private companies are rapidly expanding into the industry. By leading with sustainable marketing, you distinguish yourself from the competition and capture a niche market.\n\n3. Strategic Alliances: Green initiatives often lead to the formation of invaluable partnerships and collaborations. By promoting sustainability, you can build relationships with like-minded organisations and governments.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: As space governance evolves, environmentally responsible practices may become mandatory. By adopting sustainability early, you position yourself ahead of potential regulations.\n\n5. Ethical Impact: Beyond profit, the space industry is about the greater good, and a sustainable approach embodies this ethos, inspiring stakeholders and driving positive change.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we have harnessed the power of sustainable marketing. We understand that it’s not just about doing the right thing; it’s also about doing the smart thing for your business. Our expertise, honed in the realms of marketing and sustainability, enables us to guide space-related businesses toward a greener future.\n\nJoin us on this extraordinary journey to rewrite the rules of space marketing.

Our involvement underscores our dedication to leveraging technology and creativity to address critical environmental challenges. This year, we bring forward the idea of Ocean Explorer—a unique fusion of cutting-edge digital tools and sustainability-focused education.\n\n## Embracing Innovation and Sustainability\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we believe that effective marketing goes beyond promoting products; it entails championing causes that matter. Our participation in #OceanHack4EU aligns perfectly with our mission to foster a sustainable future through innovative digital solutions. Ocean Explorer epitomises this mission, aiming to bridge the gap between oceanic science and public awareness.\n\n## The Importance of the Ocean\n\nWe all know the ocean’s central role in our lives and how much humanity depends on its good health. However, we are still learning about it: 95% of it is still unexplored, and new organisms are regularly being discovered. The oceans are not just vast bodies of water but crucial ecosystems supporting life on our planet. The ocean provides food and is a climate regulator, absorbing 25% of our CO2 emissions and 90% of surplus heat from global warming. While the ocean plays a crucial role in the lives of many communities and offers numerous opportunities, it faces threats from climate change and increasing pressures stemming from human activities. These factors affect the health and resilience of marine environments and biodiversity.\n\n## Ocean Explorer: A Vision for the Future\n\nIt’s time to act. That’s why we’re joining #OceanHack4EU, a hackathon to find data-driven solutions to these challenges. Join us as we dive deep into innovation and emerge with prototypes that can make a real difference. Let’s protect our oceans and unlock their potential together. The #OceanHack4EU online hackathon is organised by Mercator Ocean International, an implementer of the EU Copernicus Marine Service, on behalf of the European Commission and carried out by Garage48. During this #OceanHack4EU, the participants are invited to use data and information from the EU’s Copernicus Marine Service to tackle the challenge they want. Other EU marine data providers EMODnet and EUMETSAT, data partners of the event, will support the teams.\n\nThis event echoes Mercator Ocean International’s mission towards global ocean knowledge for a sustainable ocean aligned with the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development vision. It also reflects the aim of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and waters” to protect and restore the health of our ocean and waters through research and innovation, citizen engagement, and blue investments.\n\nOcean Explorer is designed to inspire a deeper connection with the ocean and promote marine conservation through interactive and engaging educational resources. By harnessing the power of Copernicus Marine Service data, our project provides real-time insights into ocean health, climate impacts, and marine biodiversity.\n\n## Key Features of Ocean Explorer:\n\n1. Interactive Educational Apps: These apps offer virtual tours of marine ecosystems, allowing users to explore the wonders of the ocean from their devices. Interactive maps and simulations bring oceanographic data to life, making learning both fun and informative.\n\n1. Outreach Programmes: Tailored community programmes utilise Copernicus data to highlight the importance of ocean conservation. Workshops and seminars aim to educate and inspire communities to take action.\n\n1. Interactive Learning Materials: We develop multimedia resources, hands-on activities, and online tools that explain critical oceanic processes like acidification, coral bleaching, and pollution. These materials are designed to be accessible and engaging for all age groups.\n\n1. Citizen Science Initiatives: Ocean Explorer empowers citizens to contribute to marine research by providing platforms for data collection and analysis. This initiative not only enhances scientific research but also fosters a sense of community and responsibility.\n\n1. Artistic Collaborations: By partnering with artists, we aim to create visually compelling art inspired by ocean data. These artworks serve as powerful tools to raise awareness and evoke emotional connections to marine conservation.\n\n## Merging Marketing Expertise with Environmental Advocacy\n\nOur extensive experience in digital marketing enables us to effectively promote Ocean Explorer and maximise its reach. We employ targeted campaigns, social media strategies, and compelling storytelling to engage diverse audiences and drive home the message of marine conservation. Our goal is to ensure that Ocean Explorer not only educates but also motivates individuals and communities to become active stewards of the ocean.\n\n## Impact and Vision\n\nOcean Explorer has the potential to transform how people perceive and interact with the ocean. By making oceanic data accessible and engaging, we aim to cultivate a generation that values and protects marine environments. Our project’s success will be measured by its ability to inspire behavioural change, enhance community engagement, and support scientific research.\n\n## Join Us on Our Journey\n\nGreen Orbit Digital invites you to join us on this exciting journey. Follow our progress at #OceanHack4EU and witness how Ocean Explorer evolves from an innovative idea to a transformative educational tool. Together, we can make a lasting impact on marine conservation and ensure a sustainable future for our oceans.\n\nStay tuned for updates and follow us on social media for the latest news on Ocean Explorer and our other sustainability initiatives.

This event, co-organised by the Portuguese Space Agency and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), gathered a diverse array of stakeholders, including Member States, civil and youth organisations, industry leaders, and academic experts, to address the pressing issues of outer space sustainability and governance. Our engagement in the conference underscored the pivotal role of marketing and communications in fostering a multi-stakeholder dialogue.\n\nEffective communication strategies are essential to ensure that all parties involved understand the impact of space activities and are aligned in their efforts towards sustainable development. By prioritising transparency and authenticity, Green Orbit Digital contributes to avoiding greenwashing—a practice that can undermine trust and progress. \n\nThe Lisbon Declaration on Outer Space, emerging from this conference, highlighted several key themes that resonate with our values and mission at Green Orbit Digital: \n\n1. Inclusive and Sustainable Space Governance: The declaration emphasised the need for comprehensive international cooperation and consensus through platforms such as the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). This collaborative approach aims to develop voluntary principles and guidelines addressing space debris, traffic management, and resource utilisation. \n\n1.

This endorsement represents a firm stand against environmental degradation and an embrace of sustainable practices both within and beyond the company’s digital marketing services.\n\n## Why the Plant Based Treaty?\n\nThe Plant Based Treaty is a bold initiative designed to complement the Paris Agreement by addressing the climate impacts of food systems. It places animal agriculture at the centre of the climate conversation, advocating a global shift toward plant-based diets as a pathway to protect ecosystems, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote food security worldwide. By endorsing the Treaty, Green Orbit Digital joins a growing network of individuals, organisations, and cities advocating for systemic change that prioritises the planet’s health.\n\n> \n“We believe that as an organisation shaping narratives in the space industry, we have an important role to play in promoting sustainability. Endorsing the Plant Based Treaty aligns with our values and demonstrates our commitment to advocating for greener futures—not only in space but here on Earth.” – said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.\n\n\n## A Plan of Action: Workshops and Events to Promote Plant-Based Principles\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty is just the beginning. The agency is organising a series of workshops and events designed to educate, inspire, and activate sustainable practices in the space sector. These events will aim to:\n\n- Promote Awareness: Green Orbit Digital will host virtual and in-person webinars, bringing experts to discuss the links between food systems, climate change, and sustainable business. These sessions will also address how plant-based solutions can contribute to global sustainability.\n\n- Educate on Practical Implementation: In collaboration with environmental NGOs, Green Orbit Digital will facilitate workshops to introduce the principles of the Treaty, offering practical insights into shifting organisational practices toward plant-based policies, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable food systems.\n\n- Integrate Plant-Based Principles into Business Strategy: Specialised sessions will guide companies in the space industry on how they can integrate plant-based principles in their operations, catering options, and employee engagement programmes.\n\n## Core Principles of the Treaty\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s initiatives will focus on three main principles, mirroring the Treaty’s key demands:\n\n1. Redirect: These efforts will work to eliminate the underlying causes of climate damage by encouraging a transition to plant-based systems. Green Orbit Digital will advocate for plant-based alternatives within their clients’ and partners’ operations and is developing informational campaigns on the environmental benefits of a plant-based approach.\n\n1. Relinquish: This principle calls for halting the expansion of harmful practices like deforestation for animal agriculture. Green Orbit Digital aims to influence public discourse by promoting responsible consumption, production, and urban greening projects. Partnering with cities, they will support green initiatives aimed at increasing green spaces, wildlife corridors, and local plant-based food systems.\n\n1. Restore: This principle seeks active ecological restoration. Green Orbit Digital will sponsor community rewilding and reforestation projects, aligning with Treaty goals of replanting critical ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity, and supporting rewilding efforts in communities. These projects will aim to create green oases in urban areas, as well as offering grants for local communities to establish sustainable food gardens.\n\n## Building a Global Movement in the Space Sector\n\nBy adopting the Plant Based Treaty’s goals and weaving them into its ethos, Green Orbit Digital is taking a leadership role in sustainable transformation within the space industry. This endorsement not only signals a commitment to responsible stewardship but also encourages others within the sector to embrace plant-based solutions as a vital element of the climate solution.\n\nIn the words of Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth.” Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty reflects this wisdom, showing how organisations can be leaders in reducing climate impacts.\n\nAs Green Orbit Digital embarks on this path, it invites other space industry leaders to join the movement, furthering the cause of a sustainable planet that can thrive alongside human innovation.","src/content/news/plant-based-treaty.md","8b1fcca442bf7417",{"html":1150,"metadata":1151},"\u003Cp>In a landmark commitment to environmental responsibility, Green Orbit Digital has proudly endorsed the Plant Based Treaty, aligning with its mission to drive eco-conscious innovation in the space industry.
